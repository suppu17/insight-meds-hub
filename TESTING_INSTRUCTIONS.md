# Testing OCR Medication Recognition

## üéØ **OCR Issues Fixed:**

I've implemented comprehensive improvements to fix the OCR medication recognition:

### ‚úÖ **What Was Fixed:**

1. **Enhanced OCR Settings**:
   - Removed restrictive character whitelist
   - Used LSTM OCR engine mode for better accuracy
   - Improved page segmentation for prescription labels

2. **Comprehensive Debugging**:
   - Added detailed console logging for every step
   - Shows raw OCR text, extraction patterns, and results
   - Fallback extraction for edge cases

3. **Multiple Extraction Patterns**:
   - Known medication names (expanded database)
   - Generic patterns for drug endings (-illin, -mycin, etc.)
   - All-caps words (common on prescription labels)
   - Words with dosage indicators
   - Fallback extraction for any reasonable candidates

4. **Test Mode**:
   - Upload any image named with "test" in filename
   - Will use sample prescription text to verify extraction logic

## üß™ **Testing Steps:**

### Option 1: Test Mode (Recommended)
1. Create any small image file and name it `test.jpg` or `test.png`
2. Upload this file to test the extraction logic without OCR dependency
3. Should immediately recognize "FUNICILLIN" from sample text

### Option 2: Real OCR Test
1. Upload your actual prescription label image
2. Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
3. Go to Console tab
4. Look for detailed debug logs starting with üîç emojis
5. Check what text OCR extracted and why medications were/weren't found

### Option 3: Debug Real Issue
If OCR still fails:
1. Check console for these debug messages:
   - "Raw OCR Text:" - What Tesseract actually extracted
   - "All words (3+ chars):" - All potential medication words
   - "Pattern X Matches found:" - What each extraction pattern found
   - "Fallback candidates:" - Last resort extractions

## üîç **Expected Console Output:**

When working correctly, you should see:
```
üöÄ Starting document processing for: [filename]
üîç DEBUGGING OCR EXTRACTION:
Raw OCR Text Length: [number]
Full OCR Text: [extracted text]
üîç TESTING EXTRACTION PATTERNS:
‚úÖ Found medication: "funicillin" from match: "FUNICILLIN"
```

## üö® **If Still Not Working:**

The console logs will show exactly where the issue is:
- **OCR Problem**: If "Raw OCR Text" is empty or garbled
- **Extraction Problem**: If OCR text looks good but no medications found
- **Pattern Problem**: If medications are there but patterns don't match

## üìã **Quick Test:**

1. **Right now**: Upload any image named "test.jpg" to bypass OCR
2. **Should work**: Extraction logic will use sample text with "FUNICILLIN"
3. **If this works**: OCR is the issue, if not - extraction logic needs fixing

Let me know what the console shows when you test! üîß
